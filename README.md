Hi, I'm **Melody**! I've been coding for over 7 years now, and I'm quite experienced.

I'm currently working on [Hexatronic](https://eternabyte.itch.io/hexahetronic) and dr3ds (a WIP 3ds Undertale/Deltarune port!)

### What about your OneShot projects?

Burnount, awful code, and the OneShot community have all pushed me to stop working on Luminol and OneShot: Fading Memory. 
While I might occasionally contribute to them, I don't want to be involved with anything OneShot related anymore.

### Hiring

If you'd like to hire me, I am currently looking for remote employment. You can reach out to me at the email on my profile!

I code in a *lot* of languages and can generally pick them up quickly. I'm best at Rust and C, but I started with Ruby! 
I don't usually work with high level languages, my experience with C/Rust makes them frustrating.
Languages like C# are exceptions to that though!

Aside from the language, I can work in practically any field- I have the most experience in anything related to game development.
I've written entire [game](https://github.com/callistoAshley/yuri-jam24) [engines](https://github.com/Astrabit-ST/wormhole) from scratch before!
